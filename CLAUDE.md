- This is a project that serves as a container for small, personal applications.
- Every application should be a separate Vite endpoint, so that they can be accessed separately.
- There's an application called tauri-container that Tauri uses as it's main window on startup
- The project uses Tailwind for styling.
- Applications use an event system for communication. They use an EventContext in React, that provides different functionality based on the environment. Right now it only serves as a provider for the Tauri event system.
- Every event type and its payload  should be defined in the shared package. The app-message event that is used right now should not work without being defined there. I want type safe communication
- Calendar app - an app that allows the user to select a day in a calendar and emits an event with the currently selected date
- Weather app - displays weather data from OpenWeather. It uses a Rust endpoint to fetch weather data. Reacts to calendar events to refetch weather data. Handles unavailable data. On weather data change emits an event.
- Applications should not have headers and exxessive paddings. Their styling should really be more akin to a widget. Application name should be visible in window title in case of Tauri and in Tab name in case of Web context
- Project should have a configurable color palette that depends on CSS selectors for top-level dark, light and other data-theme attributes. The palette should be defined with CSS variables and changed accordingly
